# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Briefly summarized Language Translation Models that i have to implement, from S(N)MT to BERT (Is in progress.)

**Thoughts:** I thought I should know more about the definition of statistical neural machine translation.

I found that the memory dependency problem and computational complexity are also a problem in NLP.
