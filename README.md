# 100 Days of NLP with code

This repository introduces the fundamental concepts and ideas in natural language processing.

## Motivation

I started this project from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuQMBj1cWPo&t=7s) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval for the #100DaysofMLCode Challenge.

## Project Ideas

I decided to review fundamental concepts and ideas in natural language processing(NLP), otherwise known as computational linguistics.

I will make a document and code from both a linguistic and an algorithmic perspective. Through this repository, you can see the necessary skills to design, implement, and understand their own neural network models.

As you know, I will focuse on modern quantitative techniques in NLP. Also I will try to explain and implement linguistic knowledge.


#### The task is to implement the below contents and explain.

Maybe i will use R, python and julia.

(Isn't there anyone to teach me js?)

## The 3 Rules

- Make a public pledge to code or study machine learning for minimum 1 hour every day for the next 100 days via your favorite social platform using the [#100DaysofMLCode](https://twitter.com/sirajraval/status/1014758160572141568) Hashtag.
- Make a public log of your work. Update it daily. Here is a GitHub example [template](https://gist.github.com/llSourcell/43194e486a92532bc343f7837b178eda). Another one is [here](https://github.com/LordSomen/100DaysOfML/blob/master/Log.md). You can also
make a blog or vlog. 
- If you see someone make a post using the #100DaysofMLCode hashtag, encourage them via a 'like', 'share', or comment!
